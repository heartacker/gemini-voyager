# Rendering and export regression notes

Read this file when changing Mermaid, KaTeX, rendered previews, Quote Reply, or conversation export
output.

## Gemini turns must be paired by document order

- **Trap:** Conversation export could omit or duplicate most Gemini responses, and collapse repeated
  prompts into one, when virtualized turns exposed a mix of zero and nonzero `offsetTop` values.
  Turn elements can have different offset parents, so their local offsets are not comparable.
- **Rule:** Pair each response with the preceding user turn using DOM document order, bounded by the
  next user turn. Keep repeated prompts as separate turns; selector queries are already unique and
  top-level filtered. Do not use layout offsets as a shared conversation coordinate system.
- **Guard:** `src/pages/content/export/__tests__/chatPairs.test.ts` and
  `src/pages/content/fork/__tests__/chatPairs.test.ts` cover the export and fork collectors with
  repeated prompts and mixed virtualized offsets.

## Sanitized Mermaid SVGs must retain theme CSS and SVG labels

- **Trap:** Mermaid flowcharts turned black, then lost labels after the theme was restored. The CSS
  guard rejected Mermaid's contained tooltip `z-index` and removed the generated `<style>` block;
  DOMPurify removed HTML-label `foreignObject` nodes. Direct `main` commit `109a6698` introduced the
  over-broad guard in v1.8.0.
- **Rule:** Keep contained tooltip stacking while continuing to reject viewport-escaping CSS, render
  labels as sanitizable SVG text, translate simple HTML emphasis to Mermaid Markdown, and decode
  Mermaid's double-escaped ampersands only inside sanitized SVG text nodes.
- **Guard:** `src/pages/content/mermaid/__tests__/mermaid.test.ts` covers safe theme CSS, SVG
  labels, emphasis, entities, and unsafe escape CSS. Also check a real Gemini flowchart in Chrome; a
  synthetic malicious style fixture alone misses this regression.

## Rendered Quote Reply blocks must preserve their raw markers

- **Trap:** Quote Reply could leave raw `>` lines ungrouped in the live composer even when sent
  quotes were styled. Styling a sent user message could also remove its markers from export,
  timeline summaries, or cleanup, and user LaTeX rendering could later erase the visual treatment.
  Gemini uses separate DOM shapes for the editable Quill composer and sent user messages. The
  displayed user-message DOM is also shared by several features: the LaTeX renderer rebuilds
  matching paragraph contents, while export and timeline code still read the original text from
  those same paragraphs.
- **Rule:** Classify consecutive composer paragraphs with CSS classes only so caret, IME, and
  submitted Markdown remain native. Group sent quoted paragraphs in a semantic blockquote, hide each
  marker without deleting it, reapply decoration after relevant DOM changes, and restore the
  original structure during teardown.
- **Guard:** `src/pages/content/quoteReply/__tests__/renderedQuotes.test.ts` verifies raw-text
  preservation, composer grouping and live edits, idempotence, late messages, renderer repaint,
  teardown, and browser-neutral logical CSS. The Quote Reply integration suite verifies that
  rendering remains active when its insertion action is disabled.

## Rendered code previews must tear down when their source stops matching

- **Trap:** A WaveDrom block could keep showing and exporting its old diagram after the source
  became invalid or its language label changed to ordinary JSON. The renderer returned early on
  invalid or newly ineligible source without unwrapping the previously rendered block.
- **Rule:** Share one per-wrapper teardown path between runtime disable, parse failure, and
  language/content reclassification. Restore the native code block and copy control and clear the
  render markers.
- **Guard:** `src/pages/content/wavedrom/__tests__/wavedrom.test.ts`
  (`restores the source block when explicit WaveDrom becomes invalid` and
  `restores the source block when a rendered generic block gets a specific label`).

## WaveDrom timing lines must survive a dead inline skin style block

- **Trap:** On some Edge/Chromium pages the timing lines in a WaveDrom diagram were invisible
  while the text labels stayed readable. The bundled WaveDrom skin ships its CSS inside the
  SVG's own `<style>` block; when that block is not applied by the host page, every `path`
  falls back to the SVG defaults (`stroke:none` + black `fill`) and the waves render as
  invisible black-filled polygons, while `text` keeps its default black fill and stays visible.
  The bug is invisible in normal Chrome, where the inline style always applies.
- **Rule:** Never rely on the SVG-internal skin stylesheet alone. The external
  `#gv-wavedrom-styles` sheet must mirror the light skin values (`s1`/`s2`/`s3`/`s4`/`s16`
  strokes, `s5`/`s6` fills, `info`/`muted`/`warning`/`error`/`success` text colours) for both
  `.gv-wavedrom-diagram svg` and `.gv-wavedrom-modal-content svg` scopes. Keep the fallback
  values in sync with `WAVEDROM_THEME_MODE` (`'light'`), since identical specificity means the
  inline skin style wins whenever it does apply, so normal rendering is unchanged.
- **Guard:** `src/pages/content/wavedrom/__tests__/wavedrom.test.ts`
  (`injects fallback skin rules so wave lines survive a dead inline style block`).

## User export HTML must materialize multiline text

- **Trap:** PDF and image exports collapsed line breaks inside a multiline user prompt even though
  Markdown and JSON retained the original text. The user-content extractor escaped a multiline text
  part into one paragraph but left newline characters as HTML whitespace, which browsers collapse.
- **Rule:** Escape the text first, then serialize its newline characters as explicit `<br />`
  elements. Keep the plain-text representation unchanged.
- **Guard:** `src/pages/content/export/adapter/__tests__/platformAdapters.test.ts`
  (`renders multiline user prompts with explicit HTML line breaks`).

## Export fetch limits must not delete rendered content

- **Trap:** PDF and PNG exports silently omitted images after the first 40. The image fetch cap was
  implemented by removing later image nodes from the render tree, conflating bounded network
  inlining with content preservation.
- **Rule:** Inline at most 40 images, but leave every remaining rendered image and its original
  source intact for the browser renderer.
- **Guard:** `src/features/export/services/__tests__/ImageExportService.test.ts` and
  `src/features/export/services/__tests__/PDFPrintService.test.ts`
  (`preserves images beyond the inlining fetch cap`).

## Mermaid must honor Gemini explicit light theme

- **Trap:** With Gemini set to light while the browser reported a dark system preference, Mermaid
  diagrams rendered with the dark theme. Mermaid treated generic `body`/`html` dark markers as equal
  to Gemini's higher-priority `.theme-host.light-theme`, so stale outer markers could override the
  active Gemini theme.
- **Rule:** Resolve `.theme-host` first, then generic page markers, and only then fall back to the
  browser preference.
- **Guard:** `src/pages/content/mermaid/__tests__/mermaid.test.ts` (`resolveMermaidTheme`).

## KaTeX radicals need their SVG layout preserved before export

- **Trap:** PDF/image exports rendered square-root radicals and fractions misaligned, especially for
  Gemini math such as `\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414`. Export rendering changed display/layout primitives
  around Gemini's KaTeX/SVG radical nodes. The live DOM looked acceptable, but the export clone lost
  enough layout information for radicals to shift.
- **Rule:** Preserve KaTeX layout primitives and inline radical SVG layout before PDF/image
  rendering.
- **Guard:** `src/features/export/services/__tests__/DOMContentExtractor.test.ts`
  `src/features/export/services/__tests__/PDFPrintService.test.ts`
  `src/features/export/services/__tests__/ImageRenderService.test.ts`
  `src/features/export/services/__tests__/PDFPrintService.test.ts` `bun run verify:katex-export`

## KaTeX image export does not follow the PDF path

- **Trap:** PDF export rendered square-root formulas correctly, but image export still misplaced
  radicals/fraction layout. It was easy to think the fix worked by only checking the PDF output. PDF
  and image exports use different render paths. The image path goes through `html-to-image`, which
  clones the target node and may scan the whole page's stylesheets. On Gemini, cross-origin
  stylesheets can trip `cssRules` access and KaTeX radicals/fractions depend on fragile `.vlist`,
  `.pstrut`, `.sqrt`, and stretchy SVG/image layout rules, not just the KaTeX font files.
- **Rule:** Use Fable 5's verified image-path fix: supply scoped KaTeX font CSS via `fontEmbedCSS`
  and inline the critical KaTeX layout primitives before capture. The verification harness must
  exercise `ImageRenderService.renderTargetToBlob`, not a direct `html-to-image` call or the PDF
  print flow.
- **Guard:** `src/features/export/services/__tests__/ImageRenderService.test.ts`
  `bun run verify:katex-export`

## Mermaid exports must prefer the rendered diagram over hidden source

- **Trap:** PDF and image exports showed Mermaid source code even when Voyager displayed a rendered
  diagram in the conversation. The Mermaid wrapper contains both the hidden `code-block` and the
  rendered SVG. The DOM extractor's generic nested-code-block branch matched the wrapper first,
  emitted `<pre><code>`, and skipped the diagram. The same shortcut could match a parent
  `response-element` or list before traversal reached the wrapper.
- **Rule:** For rich exports, emit a clean `.gv-export-mermaid` clone when the wrapper has a
  rendered SVG; preserve fenced source for text output and as the no-SVG fallback. Recurse through
  response and list wrappers so the Mermaid node is reached and text indentation survives. Rasterize
  only the export clone at 2x before PDF or whole-document PNG rendering, keep the rest as native
  text, and scale the diagram to one printable page. If rasterization fails, replace the raw SVG
  with a sanitized SVG data image.
- **Guard:** `src/features/export/services/__tests__/DOMContentExtractor.test.ts`
  `src/features/export/services/__tests__/PDFPrintService.test.ts`
  `src/features/export/services/__tests__/ImageRenderService.test.ts`
  `src/features/export/services/__tests__/ImageExportService.test.ts`

## ChatGPT KaTeX may omit MathML annotations

- **Trap:** Formula Copy showed its hover treatment on ChatGPT, but clicking a formula did not copy
  anything or show a toast. The same feature continued to work on Gemini. ChatGPT's client-side
  KaTeX layout stopped rendering the hidden MathML `annotation[encoding="application/x-tex"]` used
  by the original extractor. The raw TeX moved to `data-math-source` on the semantic wrapper outside
  `.katex-display`. Without the MathML node, display-mode detection also lost its old
  `math[display="block"]` signal.
- **Rule:** Read `data-math-source` from the nearest semantic wrapper before falling back to legacy
  annotations, and recognize `.katex-display` directly for block delimiters. Keep the annotation
  path for Claude and older ChatGPT markup.
- **Guard:** `src/features/formulaCopy/FormulaCopyService.test.ts`
  (`copies current ChatGPT block KaTeX from data-math-source without MathML` and
  `copies current ChatGPT inline KaTeX from data-math-source as inline LaTeX`).

## Zero-width sanitising must not strip the emoji joiner

- **Trap:** Mermaid diagram labels containing a composed emoji rendered as its separate glyphs --
  `👨‍👩‍👦` came out as `👨👩👦`, `🏳️‍🌈` as `🏳️🌈`. `normalizeWhitespace` strips zero-width
  characters so stray invisibles from model output cannot break the parser, and U+200D sat in that
  character class alongside U+200B and U+200C. But U+200D is the zero-width _joiner_: it is what
  holds an emoji sequence together, so removing every occurrence splits the sequence. The rule that
  surfaced it (`no-misleading-character-class`) had never been enabled under the old ESLint config,
  which extended no recommended set.
- **Rule:** Strip U+200D only when it is not joining two emoji, checking the neighbouring code
  points and skipping variation selectors and skin-tone modifiers on the way back. Walk the string
  with `Array.from`, never by UTF-16 index, so astral emoji stay in one piece. The other zero-width
  characters keep their unconditional removal.
- **Guard:** `src/pages/content/mermaid/__tests__/mermaid.test.ts`
  (`should keep the joiner that holds an emoji sequence together`,
  `should still remove a joiner that only touches an emoji on one side`, and the original
  `should remove zero-width joiner`, which pins the stray-joiner case that motivated the strip).
